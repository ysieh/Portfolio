	    					<p>A team of four, including myself, are developing a Twitch Extension to support the dissemination of data from philanthropic streams and charity donations to the average viewer. My role in this project has been in the design of the features and overall appearance of the Extension, which functions as an overlay on top of a streaming video. The design has gone through paper and digitial prototyping, and I have conducted a series of playtests and usability testing for the product.</p>

	    					<p>In this project, I developed a series of neural networks that sought to label colors based on their RGB values. Each network was trained on a variety of different inputs (families of colors, or groups of colors to simulate the color wheel) and were then tested against groups of target colors and evaluated for overall correctness, accuracy per trial, and for speed. Results were gathered for each network and presented in the form of a research paper.</p>
